# Front End Testing Framework Setup

## Introduction

There are many Testing Frameworks for React development that are out today, but there are only 2 that are the go to for most web development teams, Jest and Vitest.

Jest has gained a lot of traction in react development since 2018 replacing the good old Mocha, Jasmine Test Frameworks. It makes it easier to test any JS project with no configuration.

Vitest is the new Testing Framework (2021) that works specially for React projects and its special feature is test execution speeds. Vitest comes as the testing framework for Vite, which is basically an opinionated new create-react-app but way faster.

We created two React applications, one using Jest and the other Vitest, in order to compare the pros, cons and tradeoffs.

## Comparison

The comparison is based on 2 main items, testing framework features and test execution speeds.

These are the main reasons because mainly, as the application we are going to work grows, the development time to create new features usually grows as well. The more code is in the application, the more time it takes to lift up the dev server and run the tests.

Also, the features offered by these frameworks and the community behind them can also impact the developers time when creating, editing, debugging tests as we have to spend time researching/surfing the web for not so common issues that can happen.

After some benchmarks I made and also some others made by the community like these ones: [TODO: https://dev.to/neophen/vitest-is-fast-jest-is-faster--ln1 ]. Some migration examples from Jest to Vitest [https://dev.to/mbarzeev/from-jest-to-vitest-migration-and-benchmark-23pl] and [https://dev.to/mbarzeev/from-jest-to-vitest-migration-and-benchmark-23pl] and [https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/migrating-from-jest-to-vitest]

The following can be said about these 2:

- Jest
  - More mature framework with support for most common test cases with React, including Test DOM manipulation utilities
  - Over 40K stars on Github as of today
  - Test execution times slower
  - Setup for Typescript/JSX is needed

- Vitest
  - Over 7K stars on Github, Vite has over 49K stars on Github as of today
  - Less documentation/information about specific test cases like DOM manipulation (WIP as of today)
  - Typescript/JSX support out-of-the-box
  - Compatible API for easier migration from Jest
  - There are some setup issues that were hard to debug (reference path)
  - Cases were it would run slower than Jest in large code bases (https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/579)
  - Test execution times up to 9x faster than Jest

## Conclusion

Based on the comparison results, I believe Jest is still the way to go due to being more mature and having more and extensive documentation online. Despite being slower, I think that when working in a web development team, a more mature framework and also a more familiar one makes more sense.

=================

- embed unit testing framework within applications.

  - Jest/Vitest

- provide the ability to generate code coverage report.

  - Jest/Vitest coverage tools

- enforce code check-in with a minimum threshold of 90% unit test coverage.

  - Jest/Vitest coverage tools

- finalize and implement unit testing framework: Jest, Mocha.

  - Jest/Vitest

- provide a poc of redux / state management tests

  - Jest/Vitest coverage tools

- provide a poc of component tests

  - The philosophy to test nowadays is more aligned with the guiding principles:
    - The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
  - https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests

- provide poc of mocking external api calls / dependencies.

- document testing framework pros and cons
